# IntelliJ installation and setup

*Please note that IntelliJ is not the recommended IDE for this course - use at your own risk!*

IntelliJ now seems to be the most popular IDE for Scala. Although the course instructor doesn't use it, he should be able to provide very limited support.

* To get started with IntelliJ, Scala and SBT, follow the official Scala [getting started guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started.html)
